Let's get started by writing a simple program in Nospace!

## Running Nospace

You can either run Nospace:

- In the browser at [the Nospace playground](/play) (recommended), or
- [via npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nospace) (the Node.js package manager).

When using the `nospace` npm package, you can use the Nospace compiler, `nsc` to compile your Nospace programs into Whitespace, and the _NOSpace runtime Environment_, `nose` to run your code. `nose` also supports running Nospace programs directly without the compilation step.

## Writing your first program

> Tip: If you are using the Nospace playground or an IDE with Nospace language support, you can use `Ctrl` + `Space` at any time to show autocompletion suggestions.

## Type annotations
