Nospace adds two commands for dealing with types explicitly, `Cast` and `Assert`. Type commands have no runtime behavior and are instead used to help Nospace statically analyse for type errors.

Type commands use the `⁠` prefix.

## Type Names

Similar to [labels](http://localhost:4321/reference/control-flow/#label), type names are a sequence of `​`s and `‌`s terminated by a `‍`.

The following primitive type names are reserved:

- `Never` (`‌‌‍`)
- `Any` (`‌​`)
- `Unknown` (`‌​​`)
- `Int` (`​​`)
- `Char` (`​‌‍`)

Any other name is considered a custom type.

## Cast

The `Cast` command is used to tell Nospace that the top item of the stack is the provided type.

### Syntax

<SyntaxTable command="Cast" inter="xs" />

### Parameters

The `Cast` must be provided with a [type name](#type-names) indicating the type to cast the top item of the stack to.

### Stack parameters

The `Cast` command has no runtime behavior and as such takes no stack parameters.

### Example

<Example client:load="react" languages={["Nospace", "Nossembly"]} example={`Push 1
Cast MyType`}/>

## Assert

The `Assert` command will throw a compile-time error if none of the possible types on the top of the stack are compatible with the specified type name.

### Syntax

<SyntaxTable command="Assert" inter="xt" />

### Parameters

The `Assert` must be provided with a [type name](#type-names) indicating the type which the top item in the stack should be compared to.

### Stack parameters

The `Assert` command has no runtime behavior and as such takes no stack parameters.

### Example

Example where the type constraint is satisfied:

<Example client:load="react" languages={["Nospace", "Nossembly"]} example={`Push 1
Cast MyType
Assert MyType`}/>

Example where the type constraint is not satisfied:

<Example client:load="react" languages={["Nospace", "Nossembly"]} example={`Push 1
Cast MyType
Assert MyType2`} error={`TypeError: Attempted to assert type "MyType2", but the top item of the stack is of type "MyType".`} />
